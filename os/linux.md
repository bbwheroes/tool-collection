## What's displaying your apps
  1. Display Server

     The display server draws shapes on the screen and lets you interact with them.  
  
  2. Display Manager

     The display manager, also login manager called is the first program that runs after BIOS/UEFI.
     It sets up your environment and asks you to log into your user.
  
  4. Window Manager

      An application that manages your windows in a certain way.
    
  5. Desktop Environment

      All above in a package. (Most of the time install with a Distro)
## Display Servers
- [Xorg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xorg) (Older with some bottlenecks but reliable, Recommended)
- [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) (Faster but not as much Support)

## Display Manager
- I recommend just using the one that came with the Disto. You will only see i when you restart.
- But there are some if you want one.
- [LightDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LightDM)
- [LXDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LXDM)
- [SDDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM)
- [MDM](https://github.com/linuxmint/mdm)
- [GDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GDM)
- [Ly](https://github.com/fairyglade/ly)

## Window Manager (Tiling)
- Most window managers are tiling, that means that they fill your whole screen. Even if you have more than one window open. This is for people who want to buff their efficiency and strive for mouseless development.
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) (Most popular window manager, so many tutorials. Recommended)
- [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) (Fork form i3 with more options. Recommended if you want more options out of your i3-config. Build from source)
- [Sway](https://swaywm.org/?ref=itsfoss.com) (i3, but with Wayland)
- [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
- [herbstluftwm](http://www.herbstluftwm.org/)
- [awesome](https://awesomewm.org/index.html)
- [Tilix](https://www.tecmint.com/tilix-gtk3-tiling-terminal-emulator-for-linux/)
- [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/)
- [spectrwm](https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm)
